## Executive summary

_Pending. Populated in Task 25._

## Methodology

Static code audit across:
- Python: `src/behemoth/`, `src/behemoth/runtime/`, `src/behemoth/api/server.py`, research scripts.
- JForex: `src/jforex/src/main/java/com/behemoth/jforex/**`.

Replay evidence: 2026-04-15 × 3 symbols. Side A = Stage 14 JForex tester. Side B = `scripts/verify_oco_tick_exact_shortlist.py`. Diff in `data/analysis/backtest_reconcile/replay_diff/2026-04-15/parity_replay_diff.parquet`.

Tolerances:
- `pred_prob`: ≤1e-6 absolute
- `fill_price`: ≤1 pip, symbol-aware (JPY crosses use 0.01 pip_size, others 0.0001)
- `gross_pips_outcome`: ≤2 pips
- Tick/bar timestamps: exact to the millisecond
